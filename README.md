# Frame

An open-source slideshow **screensaver for the Meta Portal Go** (Android 10 / API 29) that shows
your **Google Photos** or **iCloud** shared albums. Set it up on-device by scanning the album's QR code (or
pasting the link), and it plays your photos whenever the Portal is idle — with a clock, captions,
cinematic motion, and ambient color.

> Repo name: **PortalFrame** (`com.portalhacks.frame`). The app displays as **Frame**.

## Install it on a Portal

Download the latest `Frame-*.apk` from **[Releases](https://github.com/Ishtiaqhossain/Portal-Frame/releases/latest)**,
then follow the **[Install & User Guide](INSTALL.md)** (install the APK, add your album, turn it on
as the screensaver).

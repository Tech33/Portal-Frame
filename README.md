# Frame

An open-source slideshow **screensaver for the Meta Portal Go** (Android 10 / API 29) that shows
your **Google Photos** or **iCloud** shared albums. Set it up on-device by scanning the album's QR code (or
pasting the link), and it plays your photos whenever the Portal is idle — with a clock, captions,
cinematic motion, and ambient color.

> Repo name: **PortalFrame** (`com.portalhacks.frame`). The app displays as **Frame**.

## Install it on a Portal

Download the latest `Frame-*.apk` from **[Releases](https://github.com/Ishtiaqhossain/Portal-Frame/releases/latest)**,
then follow the **[Install & User Guide](INSTALL.md)** (install the APK, add your album, turn it on
as the screensaver).

## Features

- Plays a public **Google Photos or iCloud** shared album; new photos appear automatically.
- On-device setup: **QR scan** or paste the link — no computer needed after install.
- Clock & weather, photo date captions, shuffle, adjustable timing and transitions.
- Side-by-side portraits, cinematic pan/zoom, auto-enhance, ambient color, night dimming,
  and "On This Day" memories — all toggleable.
- Touch: **swipe** to change photo, **tap** to dismiss, **long-press** to open setup.

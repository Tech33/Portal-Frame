# Frame

An open-source slideshow **screensaver for the Meta Portal Go** (Android 10 / API 29) that shows
your **Google Photos** or **iCloud** shared albums. Set it up on-device by scanning the album's QR code (or
pasting the link), and it plays your photos whenever the Portal is idle — with a clock, captions,
cinematic motion, and ambient color.

> Repo name: **PortalFrame** (`com.portalhacks.frame`). The app displays as **Frame**.

## Install it on a Portal

### ⬇️ [Download the latest APK](https://github.com/Tech33/Portal-Frame/releases/latest/download/Frame.apk)

That link always serves the newest signed release. Prefer to pick a version (or grab the
`.sha256`)? Browse all builds on the **[Releases page](https://github.com/Tech33/Portal-Frame/releases/latest)**.

Then follow the **[Install & User Guide](INSTALL.md)** (supporting both 1-click automatic setup and manual installation options). After that, open **Frame → Updates** on the Portal to check for wireless
updates — no computer required.

## Version tracker

Each release publishes a **`version.json`** on GitHub (repo root and attached to the release) with
`versionCode`, `versionName`, `apkUrl`, and `sha256`. The app reads it from:

`https://github.com/Tech33/Portal-Frame/releases/latest/download/version.json`
